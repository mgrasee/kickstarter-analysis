# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The Purpose was to analyze outcomes based on the launch date, as well as analyze outcomes based on their goals. This will help provide some insight into the best times to launch, as well as insight into goals that were successful based on previous results.

## Analysis and Challenges

The data set provided contained the previous results of other projects that had been launched, as well as the financial data points of what the goal of the project was, along with the actual pledged amount. By reviewing outcomes by launch date, as well as outcomes based on goals, we can review the previous successful launches, and gain insight from those trends. If we then use those insights, and plan our launch within those results, we could see similliar results with the next launch.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

[Outcomes versus Launch](./resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)

Analysis was performed by taking all outcomes of the Parent Category of theater across all years, and all months to determine the most successful months for launches.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Analysis was performed by taking the outcomes and their goals, and plotting those results in a results table. We could then find the percentages based from those results to trend the outcomes percentages across those goals.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The COUNTIFS were a little challenging in the second deliverable, but it was mainly because I had used the pledged amount first, which yielded different results and lead to a further deeper review of each formula and what potentially was not implemented correctly. Once corrected, the results matched, and the second deliverable was complete.

## Results

1. What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
- The best month for a launch is May.
- The worst month for a launch is December.

2. What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
- The most successful outcomes are when the goal remains less than 1000.

3. What are some limitations of this dataset?
- It's a relatively small data set.
- There's only 9 years worth of data.

4. What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
- Average Pledge Amount, Median Pledge Amount, possible Ranges and Distributions.
- Goal versus Pledge line charts.
